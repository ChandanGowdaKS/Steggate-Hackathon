# 🛡️ StegGate – Secure Image Upload with Steganography Detection

**StegGate** is a security-focused web application that detects and sanitizes hidden malicious data embedded inside images using steganography detection techniques.

Attackers can hide malware, scripts, or sensitive data inside normal-looking images. StegGate acts as a **security layer for image uploads**, scanning images and returning a **sanitized safe version** before they are stored or used.

---

# 🚨 Problem

Many platforms allow users to upload images such as:

* profile pictures
* attachments
* social media content
* documents

Attackers can hide malicious data inside these images using **steganography**, which may lead to:

* hidden malware payloads
* data exfiltration
* command-and-control communication
* embedded executable files

Traditional file validation often fails to detect these hidden threats.

---

# 💡 Solution

StegGate introduces a **secure image upload workflow** that scans images before they are stored.

Workflow:

```text
User uploads image
        │
StegGate Web Application
        │
Image scanning engine analyzes file
        │
If hidden data is detected → sanitize image
        │
Return clean image + security result
```

This ensures that **only safe images are used by the application**.

# ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔍 Steganography Detection

Detects hidden data embedded inside image pixels.

* LSB hidden message detection
* zsteg analysis

---

### 📦 Embedded Payload Detection

Detects files hidden inside images.

* binwalk scanning
* ZIP / executable signature detection

---

### 📊 Image Statistical Analysis

Identifies abnormal image characteristics using:

* entropy analysis
* pixel noise analysis
* anomaly detection

---

### 🧹 Image Sanitization

If suspicious content is detected:

* metadata is removed
* hidden payload is removed
* image is re-encoded safely

The system returns a **sanitized safe image**.
